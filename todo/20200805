- PPJXC-277 [https://ccycloud.atlassian.net/browse/PPJXC-277] 
    -   investigate:
            - connection to nexus from maven repo fine
            - from oracle - [x]
            - do we need to set nexus to mirror specific repos? 
=============
2020-08-06
    - Stew: lhv added com.sleepycat.je:7.4.5 to their project a while back and
      have since removed it. They may have simply published the jar to nexus,
rather than having nexus mirror the oracle repo where the jar resides.
      The jar is in our nexus, in `maven-releases` instead of being a
repository mirror.
    - Current issue: unavailability of non-maven-central repos in nexus

states that :

By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured proxy repositories:

maven-central
nexus ships with https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sleepycat/je/18.3.12/jar
in fact it exists in our repo here: https://nexus.nonprod.ccycloud.io/#browse/search=keyword%3Dsleepycat:c770169c0b2e3ed884018e40d95fae16
1. already exists
2. version is different
3. is it a different repository? i.e.

or version

recalled Jira update

The error points to a particular sleepycat version [com.sleepycat:je:jar:7.4.5 ] that I haven’t been able to find in any external repo in order to proxy to our nexus repo. 
The versions I was able to find are 18.x, 5.x and 4.x. in maven repo.
Upon checking the sonatype documents with regards to proxy repository management, I found that ‘By default, the [sonatype] repository manager ships with some configured proxy repositories’, one of them being maven-central.

I have checked the already configured proxy maven-central repository in our internal sontaype repository and it contains sleepycat v.18.x .

I’ve also checked oracle’s docs for sleepycat, and as stated here, there is no mention of that specific version that lhv are using.
So then, my questions are:

Am I looking in the wrong location? Or,

are LHV using an outdated version that is no more available?
